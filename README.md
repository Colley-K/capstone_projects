# International Rock Climbing Recommendation System

*The sport of rock climbing has been steadily increasing in popularity. From 2012-2017, the IBISWorld estimates that from average annual growth for the indoor climbing wall industry was [3.9% in the USA](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-trends/specialized-market-research-reports/consumer-goods-services/sports-recreation/indoor-climbing-walls.html).  In 2015, it ranked 17th out of 111 out of the most popular sports in the United States ( Physical Activity Council and PHIT America). Yet, even with this growth in popularity, most of the international rock climbing websites still lack a rock climbing recommendation system. In this project, I will create a recommendation system for the 8a.nu website that will help climbers identify some unique international climbing objectives.*

#Data

[8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/)is one the worldâ€™s largest international rock climbing websites. With over 4 million entries of climbs and ratings, this Kaggle webscraping project is a sufficient size to develop a good predictor model. To view the original Kaggle data set, click the link below:

	In order to upload this large dataset, I utilized the Kaggle API in a google colab notebook in order to combat the RAM issue of my personal computer. To view my report on converting the data from an SQLite Kaggle dataset to a pandas dataframe click below:
